            ### The Principals of Test Driven Development
            ![Red, Green, Refactor](img/red-green-refactor.png)

            [@brrygrdn](https://twitter.com/brrygrdn)

            Note:
            - Test first!
            - TDD is a big subject, the detail of testing applications and techniques are a continious conversation
            - I have 15 minutes...
            - Researching the subject, I ran into polemics against TDD
            - I have used TDD for so long I worry about a loss of perspective, as I do with most tools

            ### (Re-)Discovering Test Driven Development

            #### Reminding myself why TDD is the best of all possible worlds

            [@brrygrdn](https://twitter.com/brrygrdn)

            Note:
            - This talk is a light manifesto for TDD, and a reminder of how we - as engineers - came to this approach
            - Terrible, handwaving example code; Delegate to far better, detailed talks
            - Questions!
                - How many of you test your software?
                - How many of you write automatic tests?
                - How many of you write your tests first?

            ===
            ## The ascent of a programmer

            Note:
            - This is perhaps a failing, but that I think of software development as being very empirical
            - To some extent we are condemned as individual coders to retrace the evolution of our discipline

            ===
            ## Write some code

            ```ruby
              puts 'Hello World!'
            ```

            Note:
            - We all start off issuing basic commands and making the computer do something
            - We probably did not start out in Ruby
            - Its fun

            ===
            ## Make it flow
            ```ruby
              if Time.now.day == 1 && Time.now.month = 1
                puts 'Happy New Year!'
              else
                puts 'Hello World!'
              end
            ```

            Note:

            ===
            ## Learn some methods

            ```ruby
              def greet(name)
                if Time.now.day == 1 && Time.now.month = 1
                  puts 'Happy New Year #{name}!'
                else
                  puts 'Hello #{name}!'
                end
              end

              greet 'World'
            ```

            Note:
            - Code reuse

            ===
            ## Orientate some objects
            ```ruby
              class Salutationizer

                def initialize(name)
                  @name = name
                end

                def greet
                  if Time.now.day == 1 && Time.now.month = 1
                    puts 'Happy New Year #{name}!'
                  else
                    puts 'Hello #{name}!'
                  end
                end

              end
            ```

            Note:
            - Encapsulating methods

            ===
            ## Start seeing patterns
            ```ruby
              class Salutationizer

                def initialize(person)
                  @person = person
                end

                def greet
                  if birthday?
                    puts 'Happy Birthday #{person.name}'
                  elsif Time.now.day == 1 && Time.now.month = 1
                    puts 'Happy New Year #{person.name}!'
                  else
                    puts 'Hello #{person.name}!'
                  end
                end

                private

                def birthday?
                  Time.now.day == person.dob.day &&
                    Time.now.month == person.dob.month
                end

              end
            ```

            Note:

            ===
            ## Do something terrible

            ```c
              if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(&hashCtx, &serverRandom)) != 0)
                goto fail;
              if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(&hashCtx, &signedParams)) != 0)
                goto fail;
                goto fail;
              if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.final(&hashCtx, &hashOut)) != 0)
                goto fail;
            ```

            Note:
              - In a bizarre twist of fate you have gone from writing twee greeting classes in Ruby to security programming in C, in the past.
              - Bad code is in production, people are shouting, money is being lost

            ===
            ## Fear, uncertainty, doubt

            ![HAL 9000](img/HAL9000.svg)

            Note:

            - The machine is no longer your friend
            - Most importantly, you now begin to see the need for a toolchain that promotes confidence
            - Automated testing, acceptance testing feels self-evident once you hit that point
            - Test first still seems less self-evident
            - Programming is the biggest part of our job, where the tire meets the road but we carry it out inside a framework, a process

            ===
            ## Destroy all processes

            Note:

            - Software development processes
            - Software engineering is a young art, but we have gone through a lot of different ways of approaching projects
            - I started out on waterfall projects, my first job title was 'Analyst Programmer'
            - My training focused on distinct phases of analysis, design, implementation and testing
            - The Agile movement had lot of momenteum

            ===
            ## The Agile Manifesto

            - Individuals and interactions over Processes and tools
            - Working software over Comprehensive documentation
            - Customer collaboration over Contract negotiation
            - Responding to change over Following a plan

            Note:

            - The Agile Manifesto was in 2001
            - First, yeah, ok. Sounds good. When you say tool to me in the early millenium I think of rational rose.
            - Second, Damn right
            - Uhh, yeah, I guess.
            - Hmm responding to change. After that SSL goto fiasco, this worries me a bit. I will have to think about that one.

            ---
            ## Before agile

            - Scrum
            - Rational Unified Process
            - Crystal Clear
            - Extreme Programming
            - Adaptive Software Development
            - Feature Driven Development
            - Dynamic Systems Development Method
            - Waterfall<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

            Note:
            - Programmers are iconoclasts when it comes to processes, we like to tear them down and come up new ones
            - A lot of that is re-expressing the same ideas
            - Its where we interface with people who are not programmers and to some extent these are regimes we operate within
            - Waterfall abstract had feedback loops ( Royce 1970 )

            ---
            ## The gist

            - Capture a requirement
            - Design something to fulfill the requirement
            - Build the design
            - Test that it works

            ===
            ## Unlimited change, zero documentation

            Note:
            - Straw man critisim
            - Agile can occasionaly decend to an absence of process
            - Although it may seem horrifying, this represents the state a lot of us are prepared for now through working practices like TDD
            - The technology business is about rapid iterations and pivoting of products, the more change we can provide our businesses the better
            - Documentation is brittle, as rate of change - even rate of progress - increases it becomes harder and harder to maintain
            - Out of date documentation has no value
            - Favour light weight

            ===
            ## Minimal Documentation

            ```ruby
              class Salutationizer
                  # Create a Salutationizer
                  # @param [#name, #dob] person
                  #   An object with some personal info, assumes non-nil
                  def initialize(person)
                    @person = person
                  end

                  # Output an appropriate greeting to stdout
                  def greet
                    if birthday?
                      puts 'Happy Birthday #{person.name}'
                    elsif Time.now.day == 1 && Time.now.month = 1
                      puts 'Happy New Year #{person.name}!'
                    else
                      puts 'Hello #{person.name}!'
                    end
                  end

              private

                def birthday?
                  Time.now.day == person.dob.day &&
                    Time.now.month == person.dob.month
                end

              end
            ```

            Note:

            - Minimal comments and expressive code
            - As complexity goes up, documentation fails
            - Explaining domain knowledge in comments, at length

            ## Parsing is good, execution is better

            Note:

            ---
            ```ruby
              require 'time'

              describe Salutationizer do
                let(:date_of_birth) { Time.parse '1988-06-15' }
                let(:person) { double(name: 'John Smith', dob: date_of_birth) }

                subject { Salutationizer.new person }

                describe '#greet' do

                  context 'when today is the person`s birthday' do
                    before { Time.stub(:now).and_return(date_of_birth) }

                    expect(subject.greet).to eql('Happy Birthday John Smith!')
                  end

                  context 'when today is January 1st' do
                    let(new_years_day) { Time.parse '2014-01-01'  }
                    before { Time.stub(:now).and_return(new_years_day) }

                    expect(subject.greet).to eql('Happy New Year John Smith!')
                  end

                  context 'when today is any other date' do
                    let(arbitary_day) { Time.parse '2014-06-30' }
                    before { Time.stub(:now).and_return(arbitary_day) }

                    expect(subject.greet).to eql('Hello John Smith!')
                  end
                end

              end
            ```

            Note:

            ===
            ## TDD is minimal viable process

            - Express a need
            - Express intent to solve the need
            - Solve according to intent
            - Prove the solution

            Note:

            ---
            ## Functional tests express user needs

            Note:

            - Check behaviour of systems; Doing the right things.
            - Integration tests
            - Acceptance tests
            - Black box testing

            ---
            ## Unit tests express programmer needs

            Note:
            - Check operation of components; Doing things right.
            - Method signatures, contracts
            - Unit under test
            - Testing the surface of an object
            - Dependancies are mocked
            - Signal testing muxes

            ===
            ![Red, Green, Refactor](img/red-green-refactor.png)

            Note:

            - This can be considered the lifecycle of a requirement / need

            ---
            # Red<!-- .element: class="red" -->

            - ### Write a test
            - ### Run it
            - ### It should fail

            Note:

            - Writing a test states a need, a requirement
            - We need to confirm it fails, as it might be a bad test
            - Its difficult to be confident in tests that express something the code already does

            ---
            # Green<!-- .element: class="green" -->

            - ### Write just enough code to make the test pass
            - ### Run all the tests
            - ### Confirm they pass

            Note:

            - Fulfill the need you have expressed, go no further as that is writing untested code
            - We run all the tests to ensure there are no regressions

            ---
            # Refactor<!-- .element: class="refactor" -->

            - ## Improve your solution
              - ### Performance
              - ### Quality
              - ### Maintainability

            Note:

            - Having captured and fulfilled the requirement, you can now apply consideration to the quality of the code
            - This slide is a massive handwave, but so is the term refactor
            - I would also call this step 'apply your expertise'
            - Changes can be made confidently as long as you still meet the expressed need, as long as the tests are green

            ===
            # Write Another Test...<!-- .element: class="red" -->

            Note:
            - Your next test might be discovering a new need in the unit under test, setting a performance tolerance
            - Adding a new requirement can often invoke refactoring existing code while maintaining their requirements
            - Good processes are about repeatability; iteration
            - Do the right thing over and over; confidence

            ===
            # Confident Code

            - Testing first decouples architecture
            - Expressing needs examines them
            - Implementation code can change
            - Testing surfaces leads to strong contracts

            Note:
            - Expressing needs examines them; YAGNI
            - If you get the implementation wrong, you can make changes without fear
            - New requirements are framed alongside existing ones
            - The decision to remove a test is deciding a need is gone
            - All of these are about coping with change, favouring simplicity so you can continue to cope with change
            - Continious Integration

            ===
            # Pitfalls

            - Over testing
              - Test everything, once.
              - Avoid testing third-party code
            - Under testing
              - Test integration with third-party code
              - Mindful mocking
            - Brittle tests
              - Test interfaces, not implementation
            - Thorough does not mean slow
              - Deferring to CI is lengthening the feedback loop

            Note:
            - Overtesting is fear
              - TDD helps you manage fear, also known as risk
              - Fear can drive TDD, particularly in legacy code and suites
            - Trival examples were super brittle, asserting exact strings
            - Keep the test suite fast, decouple.
            - Integration tests happy paths, paths that users should see
            - Edge and Corner cases are tested in units where cost of execution is lower

            ## A few thoughts on Rails

            ![Rails Test Dir](img/rails-tests.png)

            - makes TDD a first-class citizen<!-- .element: class="green"-->
            - does not make TDD a pit of success<!-- .element: class="red" -->

            Note:

            - Rails is an opinionated framework
              - Its also omakase, I do not use Test::Unit
            - Rails generators creates tests for components

            - Its testing opinions are a little weak
              - It has not kept up
              - Fixtures, ew
            - Model tests are not inheriantly Unit tests
            - Controller tests can be functional
            - Requests vs Features
